## News to your desktop without cookies, tracking and nonsense.

This is a teletext desktop widget program that as of version 1.6.0 gets teletext pages from 16 broadcasters or channels. One can save pages as bookmarks, adjust program window hue, set it as black-and-white and toggle the theme between traditional image pages and "modern"-look textual pages.

## License agreement

>The user agrees and understands that this program uses different broadcasters' application programming interfaces (API) to retrieve the teletext page contents, and the developer is not responsible for possible downtime or errors of the APIs itself. The developer is also not responsible for what kind of content the teletext pages display.

>The program was not developed by any of the broadcasters, it only uses their APIs in the same way they do on their respective teletext websites. The program does not collect or send any information to third parties, and the only connection established is the one between the API and the program.

>This program and the APIs are non-commercial. Do not sell this program because I distribute it for free.
